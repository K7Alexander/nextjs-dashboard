Font
- add google fonts with next/fonts to layout.tsx and wrap all children
- add another google font to page.tsx for the title

Image
- modern formats: WebP, AVIF
- add images with next <Image>
- use the same picture with different dimensions and hide it for different sizes

Routes and Layout
- create routes by creating folders with subfolders and setting page.tsx as an endpoint
- create a layout.tsx e.g. in dashboard, so all pages and subpages can share a layout 
- on navigaiton, the layout won't rerender, only the pages
- when you add something to the root layout.tsx, it will be inherited by the full app

Navigation
- client side navigation with next <Link>
